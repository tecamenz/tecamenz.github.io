##  [Multi-Core (AC) Magnetic Field Simulation](https://github.com/tecamenz/MCMFS)

This is a simple Python tool to simulate the magnetic field in a multi-core / multi-phase AC power cable. This tool was used to assess algorithms to estimate the conductor current from magnetic field readings at the outer mantle of the cable. It provides an easy interface to get simulated sensor readings from distributed magnetic field sensors around a cable.
